    <!-- Strings for the City Parks Portion -->
    <string name="cp_intro">Rapid City is a prime location at the foot of the Black Hills which
        makes it the ideal place for all types of outdoor recreation and adventures. From leisurely
        hikes to kayaking to extreme mountain biking, you will find it all within the city limits
        of Rapid City.</string>
    <string name="cp_visit">Visit the official webpage of the City Parks</string>
    <string name="cp_linking_text">The park system as it is set up today came around in large part
        due to the Flood of 1972. </string>
    <string name="cp_flood_text">The 1972 Black Hills Flood devastated Rapid City and surrounding
        communities. More than ten inches of rain fell in just over six hours on June 9, 1972.
        The failure of the dam at Canyon Lake sent water rushing through Rapid City. Raging waters
        flowed through Rapid Creek and several other Black Hills streams, overflowing the stream
        beds and sweeping trees, buildings and automobiles and other debris downstream. After flood
        waters receded, 238 people were dead and over 3,000 injured.</string>
    <string name="cp_flood_plain_text_one">Historic documents, newspaper articles, and websites show
        the civic history of the Flood Plain creation and preservation. A flood plain is an area of
        low-lying ground adjacent to a river, formed mainly of river sediments and subject to
        flooding. The 1972 Flood was a natural disaster where homes were destroyed, lives lost, and
        Rapid City forever changed.</string>
    <string name="cp_flood_plain_text_two">In the years following the flood, the city government
        relocated hundreds of families and businesses off of the Rapid Creek flood plain. The land
        was then converted for parks and recreation usage to ensure the safety of future
        generations. The Rapid City Greenway encompasses approximately 1,000 acres.</string>
    <string name="cp_visit_history">More information about the history of the flood can be found at
        the Black Hills Knowledge Network site.</string>

    <!-- Strings for the Main Street Square Portion -->
    <string name="mss_body">Main Street Square takes up one acre in Downtown Rapid City. During
        the summer, an interactive fountain flows on an ambient setting. A roughlock waterfall and
        rain curtain also flow during the warm months. During the winter, the green lawn is turned

    <!-- Strings for the President Portion -->
    <string name="pres_main_title">Tour The City Of Presidents In Downtown Rapid City</string>
    <string name="pres_main_body_one">Visitors to historic downtown Rapid City are greeted by the
        City of Presidents, a series of life-size bronze statues of the past presidents of our
        nation located along the streets and sidewalks. Whether you are enjoying downtown
        shopping, dining or other attractions, you can enjoy these sculptures free.</string>
    <string name="pres_main_body_two">The City of Presidents project began in 2000 to honor the
        legacy of the American presidency. Each of the sculptures is privately funded, and the
        pattern of placement was chosen to maintain a coherent structure and eliminate any sense of
        favoritism or political gain. The City of Presidents is also a part of the Rapid City
        Historic District Tour.</string>
    <string name="pres_main_body_three">By clicking on the US Flag above you can scroll through the
        list of presidents and select any you wish to have more information on. Or view the
